Change the path of the video and excel files according to your files.

I have submitted total 3 .py files.
For problem 1, problem 2.1 and problem 2.2.

For problem 1: Run the code in terminal. It might take some time depending on the machine. 
There are no non-standard libraries used in this code.

Run the code in the terminal. 
It should give 5 outputs in this sequence.
1. The video of the red ball moving, with the center marked green in each frame. 
2. The plotted graph showing the trajectory of the center of the red ball. 
3. The plot of fitted parabola 
4. Equation ofthe curve 
5. X coordinate of the landing spot of the ball.

For problem 2: 
2.1 Run the code in terminal. 
No non-standard libraries are used. 
The code should give 2 outputs in this sequence. 
1. Thecovariance matrix. 
2. Magnitude and direction of the surface normal.

2.2 Run the code in terminal. 
RANSAC code might take some time to be
executed because of the number of iterations. 
No non-standard libraries
are used. 
It will give following outputs in this sequence. 
1. Least Square for pc1, error. 
2. Total least square for pc1, error. 
3. RANSAC for pc1, error. 
4. Least Square for pc2, error. 
5. Total least square for pc1, error. 
6. RANSAC for pc1, error.
